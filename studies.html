                    <p>without knowing what kind of data I'll have access to, in my head I think that it could be possible to simulate inventory by measuring price action.
                        and then regulating it through it's accruacy as price action comes through. arbitrary values from algorithms stand in for what might be impossible to see
                        from the retail position--or at all, I just don't know at this point.
                        <br>
                        I don't know how easy it is to determine the behavior of a market based on the order book, are Adam's modes 1 and 2 visible in some timeframe, or accross multiple when they're aggregated?
                        <br>
                        based on the very little i know about order books, figuring out what is distribution and what's accumulation comes down to two things according what I know about @vwaptrader1's philosophy.
                        AFAIK both accumulation and distribution happen during rage-bound trading when neither seller nor buyers are competing, my understanding is that this allows participants to position themselves
                        because the market is more predicatable.
