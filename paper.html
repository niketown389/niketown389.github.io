                    <p>I've always been a sperg for how I'm saying things about the market, it's important to be consistent and as deliberate and conscise as possible.
                        So this will be a sort of running notebook of ways I want to say things and what I mean when I say things.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>sellers/buyers competing:</strong> You often hear a lot about the conflict between sellers and buyers in a market, and it's one of the things
                        that makes me sperg out the most. <em>IMHO it's an outright damaging construction of what goes on in markets.</em> In fact, I think the opposite perspective
                        provides a hallucination of the market with a greater resolution and accuracy. The aggregation of every market participant into two political parties 
                        of buyers and bulls and sellers and bears makes it almost impossible to view the market as business.<br>In reality, the entire infrastructure of a financial market
                        is built to achieve the collaboration between buyers and sellers so that transactions can occur and participants can fulfill their "needs or goals". So, at any rate,
                        buyers and sellers do not compete, however, sellers are always competing with other sellers and buyers with other buyers.<br> The term "buyer" and "seller"
                        can only be applied to a participant who is literally-currently-actually in the market, and only then is his intent--but his goals are not--discernable. Given that
                        a seller comes into a market to sell, his desired outcome is probably to sell and so to do that he needs to find a buyer.</li>
