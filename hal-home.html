                <p class="noto">I read this bit once that reality is always explained using the technology of the time. Some primordial human explaining Sun and Moon and the Northeasterly wind as people, applying the cutting edge of his social technology to explain their behavior. The wheel comes along and then the gear, and so money is the machine of society, or something. When steamships start to travel upriver their valves and pipings—and importantly the movement of force within them—become a perfect analogy for human cognition. I actually remember reading a quote where a 19th-century writer specifically did this, and went as far to speculate that one day all of a human could be synthesized using the principles of the steam engine. They’re all right, of course, especially the guys who spoke of the dance between Sun and Moon.<br><br>
                    What the caveman derived about the interconnected dynamics of celestial bodies from what he knew about the way his tribe members behaved was not even a whisper. It’s likely to me that human consciousness during the days of The Mysteries existed in a single point. He never learned anything, is what I mean, no separation. Pontificating about the gear however, and how it with other gears can be mused as people or money or politics is more above the shoulders. For starters they wrote on paper.<br><br>
                    As we went from Deities to Dimensional Geometry, the world slowmo exploded in fractals of information. Every known fact as a point connected in a matrix of all known things; when 11th-century Catholic monks and 21st-century PhD students develop their theses, towers of logic shift, swirl, and grow. All of this happens somewhere I can see and know, but it’s not where my body lives nor where my soul resides. It’s a third thing.<br><br>
                    What I’m getting at is that there is over time a really tactile sense of movement to me, and it’s directional across what I say is a boundary—I haven’t found a better term yet. I can feel something changing, I can feel something on the cusp of my awareness that I know will make everything different.<br><br>
                    The world fills up with information, the resolution of qualia increases and so experiences get more bespoke. I’ve noticed diffusion models have trouble with quantities and they like to put things inside of things. I get the feeling that there’s a 3rd observer in people, one that exists within a synthesis.<br><br>
                    The modern analogy for the structure of reality stood out as different than the steam engine and everything before by it’s purity-through-abstraction, precision, and malleability; but the neomodern analogy stands alone.</p>
